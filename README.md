# History

I began developing PConPy at the beginning of my PhD when I became interested
in 2D visualisations of [known 3D protein structures](http://www.pdb.org).
This project provided me with one of my first opportunities to perform
exploratory data analyses using the [matplotlib]() library.

# Acknowledgements

Peter Cock's (@peterjc) [tutorial](http://goo.gl/q7DNt7) was especially helpful
in getting me started with the mechanics of PDB file parsing and visualisation.
